# Progbot
This is a Slack bot based on [slack-ruby-bot](https://github.com/dblock/slack-ruby-bot), [slack-mathbot](https://github.com/dblock/slack-mathbot).

## Purpose

When a Slack message that begins with `!ruby` is issued, Progbot grabs a triple backtick codeblock from the message and evaluates the Ruby inside it, printing the results.
